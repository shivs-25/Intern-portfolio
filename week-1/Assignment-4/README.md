# Unit 3 — Case-Based Statistics Assignment

## 📘 Overview
This project applies statistical testing to real-world case studies:
1. **Teaching Methods vs Exam Scores**  
2. **Marketing Campaigns vs Sales Performance**

I used ANOVA, t-tests, and post-hoc analyses to determine which groups differ significantly.

- Perform post-hoc Tukey HSD tests to compare group means
- Interpret statistical results in context
- Present findings with clear visualizations and conclusions
