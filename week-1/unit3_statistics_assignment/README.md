# Unit 3 — Statistics Assignment

## 📘 Overview
This assignment applies **descriptive and inferential statistics** to analyze numerical data.  
It focuses on measures of central tendency, dispersion, and probability distributions.

The goal is to understand how to summarize, interpret, and analyze datasets using basic statistical formulas and Python functions.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Compute mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation
- Interpret range and interquartile range (IQR)
- Apply basic probability concepts
- Understand the normal distribution and Z-scores
- Use Python libraries to automate these calculations
