# Unit 1 — Python Programming (Basics)

## 📘 Overview
This assignment focuses on building a strong foundation in Python programming.  
It covers the fundamental syntax, data types, data structures, and basic analytical operations used in data science.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand Python syntax and core data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Use conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`) and loops (`for`, `while`)
- Apply list comprehensions for cleaner, faster code
- Read and write data files (CSV and text)
- Perform basic descriptive analysis using **NumPy** and **Pandas**

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- Variables, input/output
- String and list manipulation
- Functions and reusable code
- Importing libraries and using modules
- Basic use of NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- `numpy` → numerical operations  
- `pandas` → data manipulation  
- `statistics` → mean, median, mode  
- `matplotlib` (optional) → simple data visualization  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
