# Unit 4 — SQL Assignment

## 📘 Overview
This assignment explores relational database concepts using SQL.  
It focuses on writing and executing SQL queries for data retrieval, filtering, grouping, and joining multiple tables.

I used the **MySQL Employees Sample Database** to practice real-world relational queries.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Use SQL to retrieve and filter data (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIKE`)
- Aggregate and summarize data (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
- Combine tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`
- Apply conditions to grouped results
- Analyze employees, departments, salaries, and job titles

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL** or **MariaDB**
- **MySQL Workbench** (or terminal client)
- Employees Sample Database (`employees.sql`)
