# Intern-portfolio
- This repo contains my journey as a Data Analyst Intern. I have documented my assignments, projects and the learning outcomes. I have also attached the datasets for almost all of them.
- Each assignment and project contain their own README.md file, which has the projects description and summary, respectively. Please read them to understand the assigment and project aim.
