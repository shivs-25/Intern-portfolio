# Intern-portfolio
This repo contains my journey as a Data Analyst Intern at Native engineering. I have documented my assignments, projects and the learning outcomes. I have also attached the datasets for almost all of them.

# Data Analyst Week 1 Assignmeents and learning outcomes
This repository collects five assignments completed as part of the course:
1. **Unit 1 — Python Programming** (basic programming tasks)
2. **Unit 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (Breast Cancer dataset)
3. **Unit 3 — Statistics** (descriptive statistics & probability)
4. **Unit 3 (Case-based)** — Case studies using ANOVA, t-tests
5. **Unit 4 — SQL** (queries on the classic Employees sample database)

Each assignment folder includes:
- the final Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts and sql folders.
- generated outputs (plots, exported tables) where relevant.
- learning outcomes, short explanations and project summary where required.
